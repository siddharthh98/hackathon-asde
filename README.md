A recent study by Forves shows that more than one of every four airline flights gets delayed.
We have come up with a feature/ service that help manage the consequences of such cancellations/delays.

Our Solutions:
Our feature takes the following action in the given scenario 
=> In case of flight delays, it calls Amadeus Point of Interest API to show the hotspot areas.
=> In case of flight cancellation, email is sent to the user that contains a link for nearly hotels in case the user plans to extend his or her stay. 
Checking on any of the hotels redirects him or her to Expedia webpage for booking the hotel.
